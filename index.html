		<p> "Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent."

		<p> I will openly admit with a smile that I have failed more times than I can count whether it be with my own entrepreneurial endeavors or through my academic career. However, what I have learned is that my failure has only driven me more. The more I struggle, the harder I seem to work and it is because of this that I am who I am today.

		<p>Actively pursuing a team-member role in the start-up sector or corporate world. Interested in roles that will allow me to apply prior experience in unique, challenging, and exciting ways! I always think big picture and enjoy the occasional sarcasm. Anymore than this, and I'll have to politely charge you over a cup of coffee.
